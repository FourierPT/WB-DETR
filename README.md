**WB-DEâ«¶TR**: Transformer-Based Detector without Backbone
========


PyTorch training code and pretrained models for **WB-DETR**.

**What it is**. we implemented the first pure-transformer detector WB-DETR (DETR-Based Detector without Backbone). The new model is only composed of an encoder and a decoder without any CNN-based backbones. Instead of utilizing a CNN to extract features, WB-DETR serializes the image directly and encodes the local features of input into each individual token. Besides, to allow WB-DETR better make up the deficiency of transformer in modeling local information, we design a LIE-T2T (Local Information Enhancement Tokens-to Token) module to modulate the internal (local) information of each token after unfold- ing. Unlike other traditional detectors, WB-DETR with- out backbone is more unify and neat. Experimental results demonstrate that WB-DETR, the first pure-transformer de- tector without CNN to our knowledge, yields on par accu- racy and faster inference speed with only half number of parameters compared with DETR baseline.

**About the code**. We believe that object detection should not be more difficult than classification,
and should not require complex libraries for training and inference.
WB-DETR is very simple to implement and experiment with, and we provide a

**Q:should we also add a colab notebook as demo?**

[standalone Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/detr_demo.ipynb)
showing how to do inference with DETR in only a few lines of PyTorch code.
Training code follows this idea - it is not a library,
but simply a [main.py](main.py) importing model and criterion
definitions with standard training loops.

Additionnally, we provide a Detectron2 wrapper in the d2/ folder. See the readme there for more information.

# Usage - Object detection
There are no extra compiled components in DETR and package dependencies are minimal,
so the code is very simple to use. We provide instructions how to install dependencies via conda.
First, clone the repository locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/aybora/wbdetr.git
```
Then, install PyTorch 1.5+ and torchvision 0.6+:
```
conda install -c pytorch pytorch torchvision
```
Install pycocotools (for evaluation on COCO) and scipy (for training):
```
conda install cython scipy
pip install -U 'git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI'
```
That's it, should be good to train and evaluate detection models.

## Data preparation

Download and extract COCO 2017 train and val images with annotations from
[http://cocodataset.org](http://cocodataset.org/#download).
We expect the directory structure to be the following:
```
path/to/coco/
  annotations/  # annotation json files
  train2017/    # train images
  val2017/      # val images
```

## Training
To train baseline DETR on a single node with 8 gpus for 300 epochs run:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env main.py --coco_path /path/to/coco 
```
A single epoch takes 28 minutes, so 300 epoch training
takes around 6 days on a single machine with 8 V100 cards.
To ease reproduction of our results we provide
[results and training logs](https://gist.github.com/szagoruyko/b4c3b2c3627294fc369b899987385a3f)
for 150 epoch schedule (3 days on a single machine), achieving 39.5/60.3 AP/AP50.

We train WB-DETR with AdamW setting learning rate in the transformer to 1e-4 and 1e-5 in the backbone.
Horizontal flips, scales and crops are used for augmentation.
Images are rescaled to have min size 800 and max size 1333.
The transformer is trained with dropout of 0.1, and the whole model is trained with grad clip of 0.1.


## Evaluation
To evaluate WB-DETR(2,4) on COCO val5k with a single GPU run:
```
python main.py --batch_size 2 --no_aux_loss --eval --resume https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detr/detr-r50-e632da11.pth --coco_path /path/to/coco
```
Note that numbers vary depending on batch size (number of images) per GPU.
Non-DC5 models were trained with batch size 2, and DC5 with 1,
so DC5 models show a significant drop in AP if evaluated with more
than 1 image per GPU.

## Multinode training
Distributed training is available via Slurm and [submitit](https://github.com/facebookincubator/submitit):
```
pip install submitit
```
Train baseline DETR-6-6 model on 4 nodes for 300 epochs:
```
python run_with_submitit.py --timeout 3000 --coco_path /path/to/coco
```

# Usage - Segmentation

We show that it is relatively straightforward to extend DETR to predict segmentation masks. We mainly demonstrate strong panoptic segmentation results.

## Data preparation

For panoptic segmentation, you need the panoptic annotations additionally to the coco dataset (see above for the coco dataset). You need to download and extract the [annotations](http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/panoptic_annotations_trainval2017.zip).
We expect the directory structure to be the following:
```
path/to/coco_panoptic/
  annotations/  # annotation json files
  panoptic_train2017/    # train panoptic annotations
  panoptic_val2017/      # val panoptic annotations
```

## Training

We recommend training segmentation in two stages: first train DETR to detect all the boxes, and then train the segmentation head.
For panoptic segmentation, DETR must learn to detect boxes for both stuff and things classes. You can train it on a single node with 8 gpus for 300 epochs with:
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 --use_env main.py --coco_path /path/to/coco --dataset_file coco --output_dir /output/path/box_model
```
For instance segmentation, you can simply train a normal box model (or used a pre-trained one we provide).
